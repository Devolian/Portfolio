            <h1>Custom-Designed Websites</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I have offered my programming skills to some local businesses in the Romeo, Michigan area to create unique, 
                detailed websites to their liking that suit their businesses and help them better connect to their clients 
                and the community.  Here are some links to those websites that I created from scratch.

            <h3>Midwest Stairs / Wolverine Finish Carpentry</h3>
            <p>
                Midwest Stairs (with sister company Wolverine Finish Carpentry) is a local carpentry business that does  
                custom interior projects for clients' homes. This website was essential to 
                helping them centralize their information and provided legitimacy to their business. Done in 
                summer 2020, this was the first website I created for a professional business. The greatest challenge 
                for this project was learning how to create a website that functioned and looked professional on both 
                mobile and PC devices.
