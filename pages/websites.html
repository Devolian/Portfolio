            <h1>Custom-Designed Websites</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I have offered my programming skills to some local businesses in the Romeo, Michigan area to create unique, 
                detailed websites that suit their businesses and help them better connect to their clients and the 
                community.  Here are some links to those websites that I created from scratch.

            <h3>Midwest Stairs / Wolverine Finish Carpentry</h3>
            <p>
                Midwest Stairs (with sister company Wolverine Finish Carpentry) is a local carpentry business that completes 
                custom projects for clients' homes. Most local competitors had websites, so it was essential to make them one 
                to help centralize their information and provide legitimacy.
