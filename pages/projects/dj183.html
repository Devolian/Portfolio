        <h1>Song Guesser Web Application</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            In my first year at the University of Michigan, my team and I created a website application 
            as a final project called "DJ 183."  The website consisted of several important programming skills: 
            a back-end python server, a front-end website with HTML, information obtained through a public API, and 
            database utilization. The implementation and features of this project were entirely up to our 
            group. Unfortunately, this is no longer online for public use to prevent future students from 
            stealing our code and using it as their own work. However, the code is stored in a private 
            GitHub repository on my GitHub page (linked in the menu), so I can share it upon request.
            You can see the bare bones of the website 
            <a href="http://dj183bursley.herokuapp.com/" style="color: #0000EE;" target="_blank">here.</a>

                <h3>The Game</h3>
                <p>
                    DJ 183 is a web application that runs a song-guessing game. To the right you will see the page 
                    that displays the directions for the user to read and follow.  In this game, the user is given an 
                    audio clip of a song based on their chosen genre and are presented with four options 
                    to guess the name and artist of the song. 
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <h3>Home Page</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the main page. Here, the user chooses a genre from a dropdown list of genres. After the user 
                    chooses a genre, they are redirected to the first question.
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <h3>Song Selection</h3>
                <p>
                    During each question, the user is given a 30-second-long clip of a song based on their selected genre. 
                    Then, the user guesses which song title and artist they believe to be correct and clicks the check  
                    answer button.  The correct song, its audio clip, and the other options are all obtained through 
                    <a href="https://github.com/guoguo12/billboard-charts" style="color: #0000EE;" target="_blank">a public API</a> 
                    for python applications.
                </p>
