            <h1>Evolutionary  Neural  Network</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>As an independent project in late high school and early college, I decided to program an 
                artificially-evolving neural network simulator using basic creatures in a predefined environment.
                I took inspiration from several other community programmers who made similar programs.  This was my first
                attempt at using a neural network to facilitate fitness-based evolution.
            </p>

            <h3>The Environment</h3>
            <div>
                <div class="split one-third">
                    <img class="image-diagram" src="../../images/map.PNG"></img>
                </div>
                <div class="split two-thirds">
                    <p>
                        The environment of the simulation is a 100 by 100 grid of tiles, generated by a given .png image of 
                        the desired may layout.  The example shown here is a map that is mostly covered with land, with some 
                        minor water bodies providing separation. Eeach tile contains a certain amount of food, a regeneration 
                        rate, and a cooldown for regenerating food after it is completely depleted, to discourage stagnant creatures.
                        <br><br>
                        Tiles can either be land or water.  Water tiles have no food and no regeneration, so it is extremely 
                        disadvantageous for a creature to remain in the water for a long period of time. The goal of this is 
                        to encourage the evolution of water-avoidant traits.

                        To view data for a specific creature, click the desired tile on the map.

            <h3>Neural Network Design</h3>

                        Each creatureâ€™s internal neural network system is the key to its intelligence. The values of the inputs and 
                        hidden layers represent the neurons, while the connections between them represent the axons of the network. 
                        A network of n countable neuron layers must have n - 1 axon layers. The functionality closely resembles that 
                        of neural interaction in the human nervous system.
                        <br><br>
                        My simulation uses a feedforward neural nework design.  In a feedforward design, input values are multiplied, 
                        summed, and run through a sigmoid function into hidden layers of values, which are then multiplied, summed, 
                        and run through sigmoid functions between each other as needed and finally into an output layer of values.
                        <br><br>
                        To the right is a visualization of my network design for these creatures.  The neuron values are shown as 
                        numbers, with axon lines ranging from black (negative axon) to white (positive axon). Empty values are spaces 
                        left for future additions.

            <h3>Feedback System</h3>
            <p>
                In order for actual evolution in behavior to occur, some form of feedback from the environment is required. 
                In this model, environmental fitness is the source of feedback. Creatures with a greater suitability to survive 
                (fitness) are more likely to reproduce, passing on their network qualities. Over time, the networks of 
                more-suitable creatures will dominate the landscape, and newly-developed traits among those suitable creatures 
                will cause disruptions in any equilibrium that is established, leading to further refinement of the network pool 
                as competition for resources drives evolution.
