<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

EECS 441 is a Computer Science capstone class at the University of Michigan College of Engineering. 
Titled "Mobile App Development for Entrepreneurs," the course teaches best practices in the design, 
production, iteration, and marketing of mobile and web applications. Until early 2022, the course 
used an [ancient course website design](http://soloway.pbworks.com/w/page/147133479/441%20Winter%202022) 
that left students irritated and struggling to find materials for the course in a timely manner. In 
response to this, a couple of fellow students and I decided to recreate the website from scratch and 
bring it into the 21st century along with most others in the department.

Over a few months, we considered student and professor feedback to create the new 
course website over several iterations. It was designed with professor and student-instructor 
maintainability in mind, and I have since handed maintenance over to future course staff.
