                <h1>Evolutionary  Neural  Network</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    As an ongoing independent project from late high school, I decided to program an 
                    artificially-evolving neural network simulator using basic creatures in a predefined environment.
                    I took inspiration from several other community programmers who made similar programs.  This was my first
                    attempt at using a neural network to facilitate fitness-based evolution.

                    <h3>The Environment</h3>
                    <p>
                        The environment of the simulation is a 100 by 100 grid of tiles, generated by a user-created .png image of 
                        the desired layout.  The program reads the pixels' colors and decides if it is a water or land tile. 
                        The example shown here is a map that is mostly covered with land, with some 
                        minor water bodies providing boundaries and obstacles. Each tile contains a certain amount of food, a regeneration 
                        rate, and a cooldown timer for restarting the food regeneration process after it is completely depleted to 
                        discourage stagnant creatures.
                        <br><br>
                        Each tile can either be land or water.  Water tiles have no food and no regeneration, so it is extremely 
                        disadvantageous for a creature to remain in the water for a long period of time. The goal of this is 
                        to encourage the evolution of water-avoidant traits.

                    <p>
                        Shown here is an example of a creature in the simulator.  Each creature has several sensors, which help it 
                        identify certain aspects of the environment, like the amount of food around it or if there is another 
                        creature nearby.  These sensors are the source of input to the creature's neural network and help determine 
                        what actions the creature will take.
                        <br><br>
                        Creatures that are successful at staying alive and feeding can produce offspring with slightly mutated genes, 
                        which imitates random genetic variation in humans.

                    <h3>Neural Network Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each creatureâ€™s intelligence is determined by its internal neural network system. The values of the inputs and 
                        hidden layers represent the neurons, while the connections between them represent the axons of the network. 
                        A network of n countable neuron layers must have n - 1 axon layers. This closely resembles neural interaction 
                        in the human nervous system.
                        <br><br>
                        My simulation uses a feedforward neural nework design.  In a feedforward design, input values are multiplied, 
                        summed, and run through a sigmoid function into hidden layers of values, which are then multiplied, summed, 
                        and run through sigmoid functions between each other as needed and finally into an output layer of values.
                        <br><br>
                        To the right is a visualization of my network design for these creatures.  The neuron values are shown as 
                        numbers, with axon lines ranging from black (negative axon) to white (positive axon). Empty values are spaces 
                        left for future additions.

                <h3>Feedback System</h3>
                <p>
                    In order for actual evolution in behavior to occur, some form of feedback from the environment is required. 
                    In this model, environmental fitness is the source of feedback. Creatures with a greater suitability to survive 
                    (fitness) are more likely to reproduce, passing on their network qualities. Over time, the networks of 
                    more-suitable creatures will dominate the landscape, and newly-developed traits among those suitable creatures 
                    will cause disruptions in any equilibrium that is established, leading to further refinement of the network pool 
                    as competition for resources drives evolution.

                    <h3>Observed Traits</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the most prevalent traits that can be seen in the simulator is the avoidance of disadvantageous 
                        tiles. Many creatures, in a map that includes bodies of water, will adapt to avoid water and tiles with 
                        little food.  Being in these areas is disadvantageous because, while the creatures constantly decay, 
                        they will have no source of food.
                        <br><br>
                        Here is an example of a creature with a neural network that learned to change direction or avoid water 
                        or foodless tiles completely when it encountered them.  Some creatures tend to back away, some choose to 
                        speed up to get through, and some exhibit a combination of the two.
                        <br><br>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
    
            <div class="float-left">
                <div class="split half" style="padding-right: 5%;">
                    <h3>Creature Count and Gene Evolution</h3>
                    <p>
                        As the simulation runs, it keeps track of how many creatures were alive and their genes through time. Creatures 
                        will similar neural networks will have similar colors for easy visual identification. Once certain 
                        suitable creatures grow in population to dominate the environment, resources become scarce and the population 
                        decreases, giving rise to new, more suitable populations.
                        <br><br>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="split half">

                    <img class="image-diagram" src="images/timeline.PNG"></img>
                </div>
            </div>
    
            <div class="float-left">
                <p>
                    In this example, dark green and dark pink/purple creatures dominated for a period of time. Once resources ran out, 
                    a period of turbulence followed as other more-suitable populations grew out of the scarcity, leading to descendants of the 
                    pink/purple populations to grow.  Once those descendants grew to capacity and used up the newly available resources, 
                    more turbulence ensued which gave rise to yet another more-suitable descendant population of the purple neural 
                    network traits.  This process repeats over and over again and is the driving force behind the neural network evolution.
                    Watching the graphs reflecting this phenomenon in real time is truly fascinating, and I am very proud of these results!

                    <p>
                        Although this program has successfully achieved basic creature instincts, this network design has some important limitations. 
                        This is evolution with <b><i>fixed topologies</i></b>. In other words, since every creature has the same neural network 
                        structure, significant innovation is extremely difficult and time consuming. Stay tuned, as I am currently working on a 
                        project with neural networks that don't only evolve through numerical values, but in their very structure as well!

                <p>
                    In my final year of high school, as lead programmer of FRC Team 3539, my main goal was to develop an
                    application
                    that creates paths on the field that the robot could read and follow based solely on user input.
                    In the first 15 seconds of every game, the robot needed to move by itself, and instead of hard-coding
                    motor speeds and times manually, this application guided the robot along a set path. This was easier to
                    use and allowed us
                    to be more versatile during competitions, where the ability to change based on your teammates' needs was
                    essential.
                    I am extremely grateful to our mentor, Mr. VanCamp, who provided framework and guidance and was absolutely 
                    essential in our journey to reaching the end product.

                    <h3>The User Interface</h3>
                    <p style="padding-left: 5%;">
                        In the game for 2018, there were obstacles on the field (shown as green, red, and yellow boxes) that
                        needed to be traversed
                        autonomously. We could only stand back and watch as the robot moved on its own, without any human
                        input. All
                        robot movement was guided by the paths generated in this program, as seen in the demonstration.
                        <br><br>
                        The user creates points on the chart that the robot should follow, and the program uses those points
                        to create two
                        separate paths, one for each side of the robot.

                    <h3>Velocity Calculation</h3>
                    <p style="padding-right: 5%;">
                        After two splines are generated for the left and right sides of the robot, the application then
                        creates a complete
                        guide of velocity values that the robot should apply to its motors in order to accurately follow the
                        path. This was
                        an especially difficult task, since the motors have physical limitations beyond what might be
                        mathematically possible.
                        <br><br>
                        Some issues that we had to work around were the minor physical differences between motors, the need
                        to ramp-up and ramp-down
                        velocities for optimal performance (including battery saving), and possible variations in actual
                        field measurements from competition to competition.
                        <br><br>
                        Shown here are the corresponding velocity maps for the
                        <a style="color: #2d30cc; font-weight: bold;">left</a>
                        and
                        <a style="color: #c23b3b; font-weight: bold;">right</a>
                        sides of the robot. This data was generated from the demonstrated path above! Turns are indicated
                        by an increase in velocity for one side and a decrease in velocity for the other side.

                    <p>
                        During competition, we were often paired with teammates that had autonomous plans that conflicted
                        with ours.
                        For example, both of our robot paths could end up colliding during the game, which could break the
                        robots. In those cases,
                        instead of having to re-code, debug, and test new plans (which was impossible given competition time
                        constraints), we simply opened
                        up the motion profile mapper, drew a new path according to their needs, and had everything ready to
                        go within minutes. This
                        proved to be critical to our success in many matches.

                    <p>
                        One major difference between this project and my other projects at the time was the necessity of
                        programming professionally.
                        Upon graduation, this application was going to be passed down to future programmers on the team to
                        improve and maintain for years
                        to come. Because of that, I needed to make sure that all code that I wrote was clean, easy to
                        follow, and properly documented. This,
                        of course, is much easier said than done. However, this was where I developed most of my good
                        programming practices, which have
                        influenced the structures of my future projects. This application is still used by team programmers
                        today!

            <h1>Song Guesser Web Application</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                In my first year at the University of Michigan, my team and I created a website application 
                as a final project called "DJ 183."  The website consisted of several important programming skills: 
                a back-end python server, a front-end website with HTML, information obtained through a public API, and 
                database utilization. The implementation and features of this project were entirely up to our 
                group. Unfortunately, this is no longer online for public use to prevent future students from 
                stealing our code and using it as their own work. However, the code is stored in a private 
                GitHub repository on my GitHub page (linked in the menu), so I can share it upon request.
                You can see the bare bones of the website

                    <h3>The Game</h3>
                    <p>
                        DJ 183 is a web application that runs a song-guessing game. To the right you will see the page 
                        that displays the directions for the user to read and follow.  In this game, the user is given an 
                        audio clip of a song based on their chosen genre and are presented with four options 
                        to guess the name and artist of the song. 
                    </p>
                    <br><br>
    
                    <h3>Home Page</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is the main page. Here, the user chooses a genre from a dropdown list of 
                        <a href="https://www.billboard.com/" style="color: #0000EE;" target="_blank">Billboard</a> 
                        genres. After the user 
                        submits a genre, they are redirected to the first question.  This project uses several frameworks to 
                        integrate the back-end python and the front-end html.  A few notable ones are 
                        <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/" style="color: #0000EE;" target="_blank">Flask</a> 
                        and 
                        <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/" style="color: #0000EE;" target="_blank">Jinja</a>, 
                        which made the project much easier to develop from a then-limited knowledge of python.

                    <h3>Song Selection</h3>
                    <p>
                        During each question, the user is given a 30-second-long clip of a song based on their selected genre. 
                        Then, the user guesses which song title and artist they believe to be correct and clicks the check  
                        answer button.  The correct song, its audio clip, and the other options are all obtained through 
                        <a href="https://github.com/guoguo12/billboard-charts" style="color: #0000EE;" target="_blank">a public Billboard API</a>

                    I have offered my programming skills to some local businesses in the Romeo, Michigan area to create unique, 
                    detailed websites to their liking that suit their businesses and help them better connect to their clients 
                    and the community.  Here are some links to those websites that I created from scratch.

                    helping them centralize their information and provided accessibility to their business. Done in 
                    summer 2020, this was the first website I created for a business. The greatest challenge 
                    for this project was learning how to create a website that functioned and looked professional on both 
                    mobile and PC devices.
